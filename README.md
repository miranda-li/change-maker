change-maker
================

Some beautiful recursion :)

Gives the amount of quarters, dimes, nickels a cent amount can be split into.  

To run: in the command line, compile javac ChangeMaker.java, then run java ChangeMaker [value to change].  

Anything non-positive or indivisible by 5 cannot be changed (it will print “[number] cannot be changed”).
